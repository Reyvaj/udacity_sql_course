# udacity_sql_course
These are my solutions to Udacity's SQL course which you can finde [here.](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198)

## Pre-requisites
- The course offers an online platform to run your code, but the instructor recommends saving your code in a different document like a file in github or a text file. I use both. This is the text editor I use: https://atom.io/

## Disclaimer
- If you are not using Udacity's platform from the course this code won't produce any results since you won't have access to the database these queries were created for.
